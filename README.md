## 1. What's this?

This repository is a collection of recursive solutions for general problems created solving a list of exercises delivered by Prof. Selan Rodrigues dos Santos.

## 2. The Algorithms

The list is solving yet, but you can find the following solutions below:

### **- Cannonball**:

The **Cannonball** algorithm calculates the total number of stacked cannonballs. They are stacked in square-shaped pyramid, like this:

                   o
                  o o
                 o o o
                o o o o

That is, the top ball it's above a square base (let's call the base as layer), the below layer is composed by the power of 2 in layer level (e.g. level 2 layer has 2<sup>2</sup> balls, that is 4 balls).

The recursive solution is calculate the number of balls from the actual layer and sum with all others balls calling the function again until the level layer is 1, so the algorithm return the sum added 1.

### **- Power**:

The **Power** algorithm calculates n<sup>k</sup> with, obviously, recursive solution.

The solution verify three cases:

- I. K = 0 : The result is `1`;
- II. K = 1 : The result is `n * n`;
- III. K > 1 : The result is `n * power(n, k)`;

So, the function is called until K = 1 is `true`, in other words, while _case III_ is true until it's be `false` and _case II_ be `true` or if _case I_ be `true`.

### **- Digit Sum**:

The **Digit Sum** algorithm takes a nonnegative integer and returns the sum of its digits.

(e.g. `digitSum(32)` should return _3 + 2_, which is _5_.)

## 3. Compiling

The project use [CMake](http://cmake.org), with **CMake** installed in your machine, use `cmake` into project folder, so use `make` to create executable file.

## 4. Using

The project has been constructed for execute many algorithms same time.

> You may use `--help` command line for understand better the use

To use the algorithms you must type:

`--algoption <algorithm_name> [parameters...]`

- For **Cannonball** use:

`--algoption cb [height]`

- For **Power** use:

`--algoption power [n] [k]`

- For **Digit Sum** use:

`--algoption ds [number]`
